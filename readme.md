# Chapter 1: Getting Started 🏁

This chapter introduces Rust and sets up the development environment. I created a "Hello, world!" program and ran it successfully. It’s all about building that foundation.

# Chapter 2: Programming a Guessing Game 🎲

I implemented a simple guessing game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number. The program gives feedback if the guess is too high or too low and ends when the correct number is guessed. It was a great way to get familiar with basic Rust syntax and the rand crate.

# Chapter 3: Common Programming Concepts 🧠

Here, I explored variables, mutability, data types, functions, and control flow. I wrote a few small programs to test different concepts like conditional loops and scopes.

# Chapter 4: Understanding Ownership 🦀

The ownership system is one of Rust’s unique features, ensuring memory safety without a garbage collector. I experimented with borrowing and references, learning how Rust manages data to prevent bugs and optimize performance.

# Chapter 5: Using Structs 🏗️

I built custom types using structs. This chapter taught me how to create and use structs to structure complex data, like building a program that models user information.

# Chapter 6: Enums and Pattern Matching 🎭

This chapter was all about enums and pattern matching, which is a powerful way to handle different cases in Rust. I used enums to create a simple application that responds differently based on various inputs and learned to match them efficiently.

# Chapter 7: Managing Growing Projects 🏢

I dove into Rust’s module system and learned how to structure projects as they grow. I also created a small library and split code across multiple files for clarity and reusability.

# Chapter 8: Common Collections 📦

I worked with Rust's built-in collections like vectors, strings, and hash maps. I created a program that stores user data using these collections, making it flexible and dynamic.

# Chapter 9: Error Handling 🚨

Rust’s approach to error handling is through Result and Option types. I implemented a program that gracefully handles file I/O errors, making sure it doesn’t crash and instead returns useful information to the user.

# Chapter 10: Generic Types, Traits, and Lifetimes 🔄

Generics, traits, and lifetimes make Rust code flexible and reusable. I created a small library that uses these features to define reusable functions and data structures, like a custom collection type.

# Chapter 11: Writing Automated Tests ✅

Writing tests is crucial! I added unit tests to my codebase to check that functions behave correctly under different scenarios. I learned how to run tests and even set up some test-driven development (TDD) practices.

# Chapter 12: Building a Command Line Program 🖥️

The final chapter covers building a CLI program, using Rust's standard library and external crates. I built a mini text-processing tool similar to grep, which was a fantastic way to put everything I learned into practice.

Rust has been a great experience so far, it is so cool to get to do C/C++ similar code again!

Please feel free to read through or use any of the code here .
