🦀 Rust Journey 🦀
Welcome to my Rust learning journey! I'm following along with [The Rust Programming Language Guide](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html) and implementing code examples along the way. Below is an overview of each chapter and a brief explanation of my implementations. Enjoy!

# Chapter 1: Getting Started 🏁

This chapter introduces Rust and sets up the development environment. I created a "Hello, world!" program and ran it successfully. As a further challenge, I created a program which took user input to display their name.

# Chapter 2: Programming a Guessing Game 🎲

I implemented a simple guessing game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number. The program gives feedback if the guess is too high or too low and ends when the correct number is guessed. It was a great way to get familiar with basic Rust syntax and the rand crate.
As an extra challenge, I implemented a leaderboard which is shown to the users after the game is over.

# Chapter 3: Common Programming Concepts 🧠

Here, I explored variables, mutability, data types, functions, and control flow. I wrote a graphical interface which you can use to convert temperature from degrees Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa.

# Chapter 4: Understanding Ownership 🦀

The ownership system is one of Rust’s unique features, ensuring memory safety without a garbage collector. I made a small function which takes a string and returns the longest word in that string.

# Chapter 5: Using Structs 🏗️

I built custom types using structs. This chapter taught me how to create and use structs to structure complex data, like building a program that models user information. The structs I built were for calculations using a Rectangle and displaying a todo list for users.

# Chapter 6: Enums and Pattern Matching 🎭

This chapter was all about enums and pattern matching, which is a powerful way to handle different cases in Rust. I used enums to create a simple application that responds differently based on various inputs and learned to match them efficiently. I built a small matching of transportation methods to the time it takes for them to travel a certain distance.

Please feel free to read through or use any of the code here.

# Chapter 7: Managing Growing Projects with Packages, Crates, and Modules 📦

This chapter focused on structuring large Rust projects. I learned how to organize code into packages, crates, and modules for better readability and maintainability. By dividing my animal simulation into separate modules for mammals and birds, I made the project more scalable and easier to manage.

# Chapter 8: Common Collections 📝

This chapter introduced three collections: Vectors, Strings and Hashmaps. As a challenge, I created a small application which counts words in a text, sorts them and displays the frequency of the words.
